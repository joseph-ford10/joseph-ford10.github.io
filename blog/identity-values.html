       <h2 class="blog-question" id="top-question">Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, 
        and how you reflect on that decision now. </h2>
        <p class="blog-answer">
          I have been in a situation where I could have got someone into trouble or, at least, tarnished their reputation in the eyes of others. 
          Although I was annoyed by what they had done, I did not, having confronted them about it, take it any further. 
          I did not want to make someone else’s life more difficult (especially over something relatively minor) and did not want to escalate a situation where 
          it was not necessary to do so. This happened a while ago now and, looking back, I feel good about the approach that I took.

        <h2 class="blog-question">Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your values and identity</h2>
        <p class="blog-answer">
          Although I don’t think I’ve ever consciously taken on someone as a role model, there have been people who, in embodying certain values, 
          have made me realise how important those values are to me. Acts of kindness and generosity (either towards myself or towards others) have left a 
          huge impression on me, for example, which has made me want to adhere as much as possible to those values myself. Humility is another big one—I 
          admire people who are willing to admit to their own flaws and how little they know and, again, I try to keep my own limitations in mind as 
          I go through life.

        <h2 class="blog-question">Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning journey</h2>
        <p class="blog-answer">
          I often think about the Picasso quote (assuming it’s his and not one of those that floats around the Internet being misattributed over and over again): 
          “Inspiration exists, but it has to find you working.” When I’m working towards a goal, I try to adhere to the spirit of this quote and show up 
          regardless of how inspired I feel on a given day. This is especially important because the outcomes from a day can be hard to judge on the day 
          itself—sometimes what seems like a bad day at the time has laid the groundwork for something further down the line. 
        </p>
        <p>
          I have created several long-term daily habits in using this approach and I hope it will be of value on this learning journey as well.

        <h2 class="blog-question">Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career development. How might these affect your learning journey?</h2>
        <p class="blog-answer">
          I find it hard to compartmentalise sometimes. If there’s an issue, I can find it difficult to move onto something else until that issue has been 
          taken care of. This isn’t always the best approach because, sometimes, you’ve just reached your limit with a problem for now and need to step away for a 
          bit—that time you’re spending pulling your hair out is time that could be spent doing something else. Although I try to be aware of when I’m doing this 
          and take steps to avoid it, I could see it affecting my learning journey if I come against something maddeningly difficult that I feel I have to get on 
          top of before I can move forward. 
        </p>
        <h2 class="blog-question">
          Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. 
          Discuss strategies you tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.

        <p class="blog-answer">
          There have been times when I’ve taken the lead on writing something. Sometimes, this has gone smoothly—I’ve produced a draft, someone else has added to 
          it, and that’s that. On other occasions, this has not been the case and I’ve been faced with the prospect of doing extensive rewrites. 
          There have been occasions (particularly when I was a relative novice) where I’ve felt somewhat taken aback in the latter situation and this has 
          probably slowed me down as I’ve done the rewrites. Looking back, I can see that this was generally a bad approach because those new versions came out 
          better than the first ones. These days, I like to think that I would be able to step back, look at those first drafts through a more objective lens 
          (this goes back to what I was saying above about not necessarily being able to assess the quality of something in the moment), and take the points onboard.
