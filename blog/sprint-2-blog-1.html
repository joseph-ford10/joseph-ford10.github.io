        Positioning content on a webpage seems like it should be simple. You have some headings, you have some text, you have some pictures. 
        Surely you can just stick them where you want, like notes on a pinboard?
      </p>
      <p>
        You can, actually. It’s just that the pins you’re going to be using are CSS rules. Some of those rules sound deceptively straightforward. 
        For example, if you type <span class="code-demonstrate">left:10px</span>, you’re telling CSS to move your element ten pixels away from the left. 
        Combine it with <span class="code-demonstrate">top:20px</span> and you’re telling CSS to move your element 20 pixels away from the top as well. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The tricky part is conveying to CSS what you mean by ‘left’ and ‘top’ (and ‘right’ and ‘bottom’). For example, there are lots of ‘tops’ on a webpage. 
        Let’s take a look at this very page.
      </p>
      <div id="photo-1">
        <img src="../Images/sprint-1-blog-1-photo.jpg" width="600" height="400" alt="Photo of mountain and lake">

        </figcaption>
      </div>
      <p>
        I’ve identified three ‘tops’ here. There’s the very top of the page, beginning just underneath the address bar. 
        There’s a second top just underneath the navigation bar. And there’s a third top… Of course there are more below that, as well. 
        It’s tops all the way down and, in isolation, <span class="code-demonstrate">top:</span> could mean any of them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Telling CSS what we mean when we say <span class="code-demonstrate">top</span> or <span class="code-demonstrate">left:</span> (or 
        <span class="code-demonstrate">bottom:</span> or <span class="code-demonstrate">right:)</span> is where the <span class="code-demonstrate">position:</span>
        property comes in. It might sound as though this property would be a way of telling CSS where to place an element. It’s tempting to type, say, 
        <span class="code-demonstrate">position:center</span> and expect CSS to plonk our element in the middle. 
      </p>
      <p>
        In fact, <span class="code-demonstrate">position:</span> is not so much about telling CSS where to place an element. It’s more about telling CSS how it should treat our instructions of where 
        to place elements. Combined with the <span class="code-demonstrate">top:</span>, <span class="code-demonstrate">right:</span>, 
        <span class="code-demonstrate">bottom:</span>, and <span class="code-demonstrate">left:</span> properties, it can be a very powerful tool. 
        If we don’t tell CSS how we want our elements to be positioned, then it will by default keep them locked in place based on their position in the HTML file 
        (<span class="code-demonstrate">position:static</span>). 
      </p>
      <p>
        There are three common values associated with the <span class="code-demonstrate">position:</span> property. 
        They are <span class="code-demonstrate">position:relative</span>, <span class="code-demonstrate">position:absolute</span>, and 
        <span class="code-demonstrate">position:fixed</span>. Let's go through each of them.
      </p>
      <h4>position:relative</h4>
      <p>This value tells CSS that when we position the item, it should be positioned relative to where it would be if we didn’t do anything to it. 
      This means that the <span class="code-demonstrate">top:</span>, <span class="code-demonstrate">right:</span>, 
      <span class="code-demonstrate">bottom:</span>, and <span class="code-demonstrate">left:</span> properties finally take on a specific meaning: 
      “Move this element away from the top/right/bottom/left of wherever it is now.” (You can also control the z-index, but that’s beyond the scope of this post.)
      </p>
      <div id="example-1"></div>
      <p>You can think of <span class="code-demonstrate">position:relative</span> as unlocking an element. Instead of being forced to sit where the HTML file told it 
        to sit, it can now be moved around freely. Remember, though, that it still remembers where the HTML told it to sit originally and uses that as a guide. 
        In fact, if you set <span class="code-demonstrate">position:relative</span> without doing anything else, the element will simply stay in place. </p>
      <h4>position:absolute</h4>
      <p>
        Like <span class="code-demonstrate">position:relative</span>, <span class="code-demonstrate">position:absolute</span> ‘unlocks’ an element and allows it to move. 
        It does this in a different way, though. Whereas <span class="code-demonstrate">position:relative</span> tells an element to move using its original position 
        as a starting point, <span class="code-demonstrate">position:absolute</span> tells an element to move using its nearest, non-static ancestor as a starting point. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Let's look at an example.
      </p>
      <div class="example-2" id="example-2-1"></div>
      <p>
        Here we have an element contained inside another element; the box is the ancestor and the circle is the descendant. 
        Both elements are currently set to <span class="code-demonstrate">position:relative</span>. Because we have not set a position value, the circle is sitting 
        where it would normally sit, in the top-left corner of its container. Now let’s try setting a position value of <span class="code-demonstrate">right:110px.</span>
      </p>
      <div class="example-2" id="example-2-2"></div>
      <p>
        As we would expect, based on the previous example, the circle is pushed 110 pixels right relative to where it would normally sit. 
        Note that this pushes it out of the container. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Now let’s try changing the circle to <span class="code-demonstrate">position:absolute</span> while keeping the value the same. 
      </p>
      <div class="example-2" id="example-2-3"></div>
      <p>Instead of being pushed away from the right, the circle has seemingly been pushed to the right. What’s happened here? 
        Simply put, the point of reference has changed. Instead of being pushed to the right relative to its own normal position, the circle instead uses the right side of
        its ancestor (the box) as its reference point. This comes back to what I was saying at the start: using the <span class="code-demonstrate">position:</span>
        property allows us to tell CSS exactly what we mean when we say “move this away from the right.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that unlike <span class="code-demonstrate">position:relative</span>, <span class="code-demonstrate">position:absolute</span> removes an element from the flow of the page. 
        Add it to an element and any surrounding elements will snap together as if it’s not there. In one way, this makes <span class="code-demonstrate">position:absolute</span>
        very powerful. You can put it wherever you want, including on top of other elements. Of course, this can also cause<span id="problem-text">problems.</span>
