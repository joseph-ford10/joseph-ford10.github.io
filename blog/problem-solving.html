      <h2>What it's like to be blocked on a problem</h2>
      <p>
        Imagine if I were to give you a sentence and ask you to remove a certain word from that sentence. 
        Assuming the sentence was of reasonable length, you probably wouldn’t have any difficulty with this task. 
        You could do it on a scrap of paper or a word processor with a matter of seconds.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, imagine if I asked you to do the same to an unlimited number of potential sentences. 
        This is where you might start thinking about automation.  
      </p>
      <p>
        One of my tasks this week was to write a piece of code that would do precisely this. A lot of the heavy-lifting had 
        been done for me: I knew which programming language I would be using to write the code (JavaScript) and I knew the test that 
        my code would need to pass in order to be considered complete.
      </p>
      <p>
        The only barrier was my own lack of knowledge and experience. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Removing a word from a sentence seems like it should be should work for something as powerful as a computer. 
        In fact, it is—once you’ve told the computer what to do. This is where the block comes in.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first part of the task… well, it wasn’t easy, but I was doing okay. I knew that JavaScript couldn’t simply change a 
        sentence and that the sentence would need to be turned into a list of separate words that could be accessed using a number. 
        I knew, also, that the code would need to go through every single word in that list and, if it was not the word that needed to
        be removed, add it to a new version of the sentence. 
      </p>
      <p>
        This version of the code was good enough to pass the first part of the test. There was a wrinkle ahead, though: capitalisation. 
        In the second part of the test, an instance of the word would need to be removable whether it was lowercase, UPPERCASE, or BoTh. 
      </p>
      <p>
        My initial approach was to make the whole sentence lowercase (easy to do with a built-in JavaScript ‘method’) and then search 
        for a lowercase match. This worked in removing the problem word, but created a different problem: all of the other, important 
        capitalisation (e.g. at the beginning of the word) was removed as well. Not good enough to pass the test. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I searched around for tools that might help me solve the problem. This gave me a smorgasbord of forum threads, Reddit posts, 
        and  documentation, which was useful but overwhelming. I tried playing around with smaller snippets of code on a website 
        called CodePen. Again, helpful, but not helpful enough to solve the problem. I tried to break the problem down to its 
        constituent parts in plain language, but I kept running up against what seemed to be a fundamental problem: how could I create a 
        function that could identify a word without knowing what the capitalisation of that word might be ahead of time? 
      </p>
      <p>
        I eventually wrote a solution. I won’t bore you with the details, but it was long-winded, convoluted—and enough to pass the test. 
        I moved on to the next task, feeling both satisfied and uneasy. I couldn’t shake the feeling that I’d missed something. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Well, of course I had! You know that JavaScript method I mentioned above, where it can easily make words lowercase? 
        Turns out I’d just been using it in the wrong place. Instead of having to change my whole approach, my original code could have 
        been slightly tweaked to pass both tests. 
      </p>
      <p>
        What went wrong here? Well, that lack of knowledge and experience surely played its part. All of this happened towards the end of 
        the day, as well. And maybe, in the same way that chess players sometimes miss an obvious threat, I overthought the problem and 
        lost sight of the obvious. It happens. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Either way, it was a learning experience. For one thing, I learned about more aspects of JavaScript than I would have done 
        otherwise. I also learned that when a problem seems overwhelming—particularly after a long day—sometimes it’s best to take a break. 
      </p>
      <h3>An elegant solution</h3>
      <p>
        In the last section, I talked about a time that I was blocked on a problem and spent a lot of time finding a rather clunky 
        solution. Now I’m going to describe a time that I found an elegant solution to a problem in a relatively short amount of time.
      </p>
      <p>
        The problem was to add some data to a JavaScript ‘object.’ Again without going into the details too much, the idea was that the 
        code would be ‘passed’ one set of values. However, these values would need to be ‘paired’ with a set of ‘keys’ which I would have 
        to find a way of putting in. 
      </p>
      <p>
        One way of doing this would be to add each key and value individually. This would have worked but it didn’t feel, well, 
        elegant enough. So, I decided to try a different approach where I would create a list of keys to mirror the list of values. 
        These could then, using a ‘loop’, be put in alongside each other, cutting down on the amount of code needed.
      </p>
      <p>
        I wasn’t sure if this would work, so I hopped over to CodePen to start experimenting with bits of code. I got something that 
        seemed to work quite quickly, but it still wasn’t clear if it would work with the rest of my code. I tried it and… yes, it worked! 
      </p>
      <p>
        In some ways, this problem was just as complex as the one described above. I would love to be able to describe exactly what was 
        different about it, but I don’t know. It was certainly another variation on a lesson I’ve learned several times in my life: 
        that the amount of time put into something will not necessarily be reflected in the outcome of it. 
      </p>
      <h3>Problem-solving techniques</h3>
      <p>
        I’ve discussed a few problem-solving techniques already in this post. Clearly, I feel happy searching the internet for help, 
        although that can be overwhelming. Writing down a problem and talking through it aloud also come naturally to me, though I’ve yet 
        to enlist a rubber ducky to act as an interlocutor for the latter practice. If I’m really stuck, I’ll hop over to CodePen and 
        experiment with snippets of code, console.log-ing every step of the way to see where the problem lies.
      </p>
      <p>
        One technique I haven’t tried yet is asking directly for help. This might come from a natural discomfort with doing so, 
        though it could equally be that I’ve yet to run into a problem where I’ve needed to. I’ve always had it in mind that I would ask 
        directly for help if I was completely stumped and simply could not see a way forward. The block described above (along with other, 
        similar blocks that I’ve experienced this week), while challenging, did not meet this criteria because the solution always seemed 
        within reach if I could just look at a problem in a different way. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Still, I hope I will be comfortable asking for help if I really need it. And I hope that writing a reflective blog post like this 
        will also help to improve my problem-solving skills going forward.
