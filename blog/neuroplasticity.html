      <h2>Neuroplasticity</h2>
      <p>
        In the broadest sense, the term neuroplasticity refers to the brain’s capacity to change. 
        Although neuroplasticity in children has long been accepted, until comparatively recently it 
        was thought that adult brains were fixed after a certain point (Fuchs & Flügge, 2014). While it 
        might be true that brains are less malleable post-adolescence (Kolb & Gibb, 2011) and that 
        childhood and adult neuroplasticity are different (Lillard & Erisir, 2014), recent research has 
        shown that adult brains are not as fixed as was once thought (Lillard & Erisir, 2014). 
      </p>
      <p>
        A famous and striking illustration of this comes from a study focused on black cab drivers, 
        who are required to memorise and navigate thousands of streets. This study suggests that these 
        drivers have differences in brain structure compared to a bus drivers, who, while also spending a 
        lot of time driving around London, follow fixed routes (Maguire et al., 2006). 
      </p>
      <p>
        Although black cab drivers’ knowledge represents a particularly intensive and extensive form of 
        learning, as Boaler (undated) notes, this research has implications for learners of other types 
        (see Lillard and Erisir (2011) for an overview of other studies of learning and neuroplasticity 
        in adults). It is easy, past a certain point, to think of yourself as being wired in a certain 
        way, impervious to new information or ways of doing things. This way of thinking can have a 
        negative impact when you’re struggling with a difficult topic. Instead of attributing the 
        difficulty to the complexity of the topic itself, you can see yourself as ‘unteachable’. In the 
        worst case scenario, you might even give up. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Neuroplasticity shows us that we retain our capacity to learn (and relearn—see work on 
        neuroplasticity and stroke recovery (Su & Xu, 2020)), which, for someone learning something new 
        (how to code, say!), can be a useful thing to bear in mind. This is where having a growth mindset
        becomes relevant. 
      </p>
      <h2>Growth mindset</h2>
      <p>
        If neuroplasticity suggests a capacity for learning, then having a growth mindset means 
        being aware of and believing in that capacity. Carol Dweck, a key figure in mindset research, 
        contrasts the growth mindset with the ‘fixed’ mindset, where learners 
        believe that they have a finite capacity that they cannot go beyond (Dweck, 2013). 
      </p>
      <p>
        Although there have been debates and controversies in the research and application of 
        mindsets (see Yeager & Dweck (2020) for a discussion), the core idea is a powerful one. 
        One of the biggest learning barriers for me in the past has been what I’ll call the 
        ‘finish line’ idea. It’s where I imagine myself reaching this hypothetical point where 
        I’ll wake up one day and, aha, ‘know’ the subject. It’s a bad idea, of course, because very 
        few subjects are small or well-defined enough that you could ever reach such a point. 
      </p>
      <p>
        It can also lead to a fixed mindset. If I see myself as not having reached the goal yet, 
        maybe I’ll never get there; if I see myself as having reached the goal, maybe I don’t need to 
        do anything else. This latter idea was one aspect of fixed mindsets that I hadn’t really thought 
        about until exploring the topic this week. It had never occurred to me that having a fixed mindset 
        can have negative effects even if you see yourself as competent in the domain in question.
      </p>
      <p>
        Adopting a growth mindset is one way that I’m going to try to avoid the ‘finish line’ approach. 
        I won’t ever know every single thing there is to know about development (I’m not sure that would 
        even be possible in a human lifetime) and there’s not going to be a bell that dings to tell me 
        I’m done. Instead of working towards some illusory end point, I’m going to focus on growing my 
        skills and knowledge relative to what they were before. This might involve setting smaller goals 
        and targets along the way, but I will try to avoid either getting discouraged because I’m not a 
        master coder yet or getting complacent because I see myself as having done everything I need to do.
        There will always be more learning to do, and having a growth mindset means that that’s both 
        possible and okay.
