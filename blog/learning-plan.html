        <h2>Updated learning plan</h2>
        <h2 class="blog-question">What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h2>
          <p>
            I know that I want my future career to involve development. I’m flexible on the exact 
            nature of the role because, to some extent, that’s going to be determined by circumstance. I’d be very happy as a
            full-time developer, but would also be happy to find a role that brings together development and my existing skills. 
          </p>
        <h2 class="blog-question">What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h2>
          <p>My biggest strength is that I know how to focus on a goal irrespective of daily fluctuations. 
            I also have some experience of dealing with projects in a different context, which could be useful. My biggest limitation is that
            I can get drawn into a task, often focusing on smaller, trivial details when I should be focusing on the bigger picture. 
          </p>
        <h2 class="blog-question">What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h2>
          <p>Keeping up the forward momentum and pacing myself in doing so. It’s funny that these last five weeks have been sprints because 
            I’m looking towards the next ten or so weeks as a marathon. I’ve never run an actual marathon, so I don’t really know how people
            do it. But I do know from past experience that long, intensive periods of learning can be a breeding ground for self-doubt. 
            Avoiding that, and trusting that things will fall into place if I keep trying, will be the challenge. 
          </p>
        <h2 class="blog-question">What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy? </h2>
          <p>
            Teamwork is the big one. I’ve worked in teams before, but the nature of team working in the tech industry is likely to be 
            different and require different competencies. 
          </p>
        <h2 class="blog-question">What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h2>
          <p>
            To keep me informed on my progress. If I’m veering off course or underperforming in some way, I’d like to be made aware 
            of that as soon as possible so that I can try and correct it. 
          </p>
        <h2 class="blog-question">What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp? </h2>
          <p>
            To put in an amount of effort commensurate with the outcome that I want to see. I can’t predict how quickly I’m going to 
            pick something up, so I can’t realistically set expectations based on particular learning outcomes. What I don’t want, though, 
            is to look back on the experience afterwards and realise that I hadn’t done my best. 
          </p>
        <h2 class="blog-question">Based on your knowledge of Bootcamp, how and where will you seek help in a timely way? </h2>
        <p>
          Depending on the seriousness of the problem, I will seek help either at a group level or at an individual level. In all cases, 
          I will try to ensure that I’m providing sufficient information about the nature and context of the problem so that others know 
          what assistance I need from them. 
        </p>
        <h2>Original learning plan</h2>
        <h2 class="blog-question" class="top-question">What is your long-term goal or career pathway?</h2>
        <p class="blog-answer">
          I’m trying to remain flexible and realistic about my career goals. Becoming a full-time developer would of course be ideal, 
          but I’m also open to other tech-related roles or to finding a way of synthesising my development skills with my existing skillset. 
        </p>
        <h2 class="blog-question">A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</h2>
        <p class="blog-answer">
          My greatest strength might be that I enjoy learning new things. It sounds simple, but having that enjoyment there helps to keep me motivated while 
          learning. My biggest limitation is that I find it difficult to learn purely in the abstract. For something to click with me, I generally have to see 
          it contextualised or applied in some way. I tend to learn by doing, which I suppose could be a strength or a limitation depending on the context. 
        </p>
        <h2 class="blog-question">What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h2>
        <p class="blog-answer">
          Teamwork is one area that I would like to develop. Not that I haven’t worked in a team before, but I would like to take the opportunity to 
          hone my teamwork and teamwork-related skills.

        <h2 class="blog-question">A commitment to how you will manage your workload in the programme.</h2>
        <p class="blog-answer">
          I will manage my workload by setting daily targets. I have experimented with using two metrics for these targets so far: 
          steps in the handbook and time. I think time works better overall, just because it’s consistent and measurable from day to day. 
          I will aim to hit at least my target every day while remaining aware that, on some days, I might need to exceed it. Similarly, I know that I will need
          to be flexible if I am working alongside others who may have different schedules and approaches.</p>
        <p>
          If the workload does become overwhelming, my first step will be set aside some dedicated time in which to relax. (I plan to have this as part of 
          my daily routine anyway, but I will allow myself to increase it in line with the circumstances.) If this is not enough, I will try to identify why 
          I'm feeling so overwhelmed before getting in touch to ask for help.
        </p>

        <h2 class="blog-question">
          A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way.
        </h2>
        <p class="blog-answer">
          It would depend on the nature of the problem. For a problem within a specific topic, I would, if other sources hadn’t been enough, 
          raise it on the Discord. If it was something larger that I felt was going to significantly impede my progress with the programme 
          (e.g. if I were to come up against a topic that I just couldn’t find a way into), I would get in touch directly explaining what the 
          issue was and asking what my next steps should be. 
        </p>
        <h2 class="blog-question">
          A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team
        </h2>
        <p class="blog-answer">
          A continuation of what I’ve seen so far, honestly. I feel as though as everyone has been very clear in communicating what is expected, 
          so just maintaining that going forward would be fine for me. Obviously if I did, as per the previous point, have a problem that seemed 
          insurmountable I would expect help with that but, from what I’ve seen so far, there would be no reason to expect otherwise.  
        </p>
        <h2 class="blog-question">
          Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things.
        </h2>
        <p class="blog-answer">
          Apart from some brief regular commitments, my schedule is open and flexible for the duration of the programme. 
          I am also planning to have those commitments taken over by someone else when bootcamp begins (or sooner, if they do end up clashing 
          with something during foundations.)
