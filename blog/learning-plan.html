       <h2 class="blog-question" class="top-question">What is your long-term goal or career pathway?</h2>
        <p class="blog-answer">
          I’m trying to remain flexible and realistic about my career goals. Becoming a full-time developer would of course be ideal, 
          but I’m also open to other tech-related roles or to finding a way of synthesising my development skills with my existing skillset. 
        </p>
        <h2 class="blog-question">A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</h2>
        <p class="blog-answer">
          My greatest strength might be that I enjoy learning new things. It sounds simple, but having that enjoyment there helps to keep me motivated while 
          learning. My biggest limitation is that I find it difficult to learn purely in the abstract. For something to click with me, I generally have to see 
          it contextualised or applied in some way. I tend to learn by doing, which I suppose could be a strength or a limitation depending on the context. 
        </p>
        <h2 class="blog-question">What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h2>
        <p class="blog-answer">
          Teamwork is one area that I would like to develop. Not that I haven’t worked in a team before, but I would like to take the opportunity to 
          hone my teamwork and teamwork-related skills.

        <h2 class="blog-question">A commitment to how you will manage your workload in the programme.</h2>
        <p class="blog-answer">
          I will manage my workload by setting daily targets. I have experimented with using two metrics for these targets so far: 
          steps in the handbook and time. I think time works better overall, just because it’s consistent and measurable from day to day. 
          I will aim to hit at least my target every day while remaining aware that, on some days, I might need to exceed it. 
        </p>
        <h2 class="blog-question">
          A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way.
        </h2>
        <p class="blog-answer">
          It would depend on the nature of the problem. For a problem within a specific topic, I would, if other sources hadn’t been enough, 
          raise it on the Discord. If it was something larger that I felt was going to significantly impede my progress with the programme 
          (e.g. if I were to come up against a topic that I just couldn’t find a way into), I would get in touch directly explaining what the 
          issue was and asking what my next steps should be.

          A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team
        </h2>
        <p class="blog-answer">
          A continuation of what I’ve seen so far, honestly. I feel as though as everyone has been very clear in communicating what is expected, 
          so just maintaining that going forward would be fine for me. Obviously if I did, as per the previous point, have a problem that seemed 
          insurmountable I would expect help with that but, from what I’ve seen so far, there would be no reason to expect otherwise.  
        </p>
        <h2 class="blog-question">
          Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things.
        </h2>
        <p class="blog-answer">
          I currently have brief, regular commitments on Monday mornings, Wednesday mornings, and Thursday mornings (before the homegroup meeting). 
          They all take about 20 minutes (if that) and have not clashed with anything so far in foundations. We are making plans for someone else to 
          take on these commitments during bootcamp.
