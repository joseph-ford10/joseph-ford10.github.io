        <h2 class="blog-question">What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to core learning?</h2>
          <p>
            I’ve learned about my values, which I’d been aware of implicitly in the past but had never sat down and really thought about. 
            The listening and looping exercise was also eye-opening, making me aware of how difficult it can be to truly listen to someone else
            and then summarise the essence of what they've said. And I’ve learned about learning—how I approach it and what my
            strengths and limitations are. 
          </p>
        <h2 class="blog-question">What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h2>
          <p>
            Recognising your values is important because those values, whether explicitly formulated or not, are going to play a role in how 
            you approach a task. They’re also going to play a role in how you relate to those around you, which is where empathy comes into 
            the picture—understanding the values of others has a huge role to play in the avoidance (or, failing that, resolution) of 
            conflict. Self-awareness, meanwhile, means taking stock of your own motivations. Being self-aware means that you can start to 
            understand why you’re behaving in a certain way and seek to either replicate it (if it’s a positive behaviour) or avoid it 
            (if it’s a negative behaviour) in the future. 
          </p>
        <h2 class="blog-question">What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h2>
          <p>
            I’ve been surprised at how much ground has been covered. I might have expected things like the learning plan, 
            but there’s been a good number of other topics touched upon as well. 
          </p>
        <h2 class="blog-question">What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h2>
          <p>
            Self-reflection can be very difficult, and not just because it can make you feel self-conscious (although that’s certainly 
            been part of it when writing these blog posts!). Understanding one’s own values and behaviours means weighing up an array of 
            contextual factors, ranging from deep-seated past experiences through to something that happened five minutes ago. 
          </p>
        <h2 class="blog-question">Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning 
          in a web development Bootcamp course?
        </h2>
          <p>
            I can think of two big reasons. First of all, any tech career is going to involve building relationships and communicating with 
            others. Obviously the extent of this is likely to vary between career paths, but knowing how to relate to others while working 
            together on complex problems is clearly a skill worth developing across the board. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Core learning remains important even if we restrict our focus to the individual aspects of tech work—when you’re sitting alone 
            in front of a computer, you’ve still got to work with yourself! Learning how to better understand one’s own learning and 
            working processes and any barriers to them is, again, a skill worth developing. 
          </p>
        <h2 class="blog-question">Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just 
          used that time to practice programming instead? Justify your answer.
        </h2>
          <p>
            From my perspective, the core material has put the tech material within a broader framework. Five weeks of wall-to-wall tech 
            without any space to stop and reflect on the learning process would have made for a less rich experience. As such, I don't think
            it's been a waste of time.
          </p>
        <h2 class="blog-question">Based on your knowledge of Bootcamp, how and where will you seek help in a timely way? </h2>
        <p>
          Depending on the seriousness of the problem, I will seek help either at a group level or at an individual level. In all cases, 
          I will try to ensure that I’m providing sufficient information about the nature and context of the problem so that others know 
          what assistance I need from them.
