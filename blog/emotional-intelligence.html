      <p>Emotional intelligence (EI) is intelligence in the socio-emotional domain of one’s life. There has been debate over how it can best be 
        defined and measured, with some studies measuring it as a trait (respondents report on their own personality), others measuring it as an ability 
        (respondents' performance is measured), and others measuring it as a mixture of the two (O’Connor et al., 2019). EI centres on an 
        individual’s ability to, among other things, recognise, regulate, and utilise emotional states (Salovey & Mayer, 1990). This makes EI conceptually 
        different to, for example, IQ, which centres on an individual’s cognitive abilities. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Research suggests that emotional intelligence is positively associated with performance in various domains. Two recent meta-analyses suggest 
        an association between emotional intelligence and academic performance (McCann et al., 2020; Sánchez-Álvarez, 2020); in both cases, this association 
        was stronger for ability EI than other forms of EI. Other meta-analyses suggest similar associations between EI and job performance 
        (O’Boyle Jr. et al., 2011), job satisfaction (Miao et al., 2016), and subjective well-being (Llamas-Díaz et al., 2022).

      Te Houtaewa was the fastest runner of his day and played many pranks on his peoples enemies. One morning his mother wanted kumara for the hangi (earth oven) and asked Te Houtaewa to go to the gardens at Te Kao, a short distance away. He agreed to fetch the kumara and told his mother to prepare the hangi.

      Instead of going to the nearby gardens, Te Houtaewa set off for Ahipara as he wanted to annoy some Te Rarawa people who lived there. Carrying two large baskets for the kumara, he ran like the wind, completing the journey over the hard sands of Te Oneroa a Tohe (Ninety Mile Beach) in the few hours it takes a good hangi to heat up properly. On reaching Ahipara, he went straight to the people's kumara pataka (storehouse for the sweet potatoes) situated at the foot of the hill Whangatauatia.
      </p>
      <p>
      While Te Houtaewa was filling his baskets with kumara he was spotted stealing the kai (food). He was immediately recognised.
