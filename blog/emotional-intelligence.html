      <p>Emotional intelligence (EI) is intelligence in the socio-emotional domain of one’s life. There has been debate over how it can best be 
        defined and measured, with some studies measuring it as a trait (respondents report on their own personality), others measuring it as an ability 
        (respondents' performance is measured), and others measuring it as a mixture of the two (O’Connor et al., 2019). EI centres on an 
        individual’s ability to, among other things, recognise, regulate, and utilise emotional states (Salovey & Mayer, 1990). This makes EI conceptually 
        different to, for example, IQ, which centres on an individual’s cognitive abilities. Think of it this way: if you're at work
        and have to tackle an abstract problem, IQ is probably going to help with that. However, if something upsetting happens 
        while you're on your way to work or if there's a problem with a co-worker, your response is more likely to be grounded in EI. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Research suggests that emotional intelligence is positively associated with performance in various domains. Two recent meta-analyses suggest 
        an association between emotional intelligence and academic performance (McCann et al., 2020; Sánchez-Álvarez, 2020); in both cases, this association 
        was stronger for ability EI than other forms of EI. Other meta-analyses suggest similar associations between EI and job performance 
        (O’Boyle Jr. et al., 2011), job satisfaction (Miao et al., 2016), and subjective well-being (Llamas-Díaz et al., 2022).

        For my own part, I think it's very important to be aware of one's emotional state and how it might be colouring your perception of
        a situation. I also think it is important to have a sense of empathy for others; an awareness of how the people around you might 
        be feeling is not only valuable interpersonally, it can also help you to understand where that person is coming from if you're working 
        alongside them on a problem.
